# Home Today list

Why Home renders today's tasks as an inline recording surface — and what the
Home view must not own.

**Activity model:** [entities/activity/docs/domain-model.md](../../../entities/activity/docs/domain-model.md)  
**Read models:** [entities/activity/docs/read-models.md](../../../entities/activity/docs/read-models.md)  
**Record writes:** [entities/activity/docs/writes-and-autosave.md](../../../entities/activity/docs/writes-and-autosave.md)  
**Workflow archive:** `app/development/workflow/activity/substeps/2-home-today-plan.md`

## What you see

```text
Home "Today's Tasks"
  └─ HomeTodayList
       └─ ActivityTodayCard
            ├─ identity + derived progress
            ├─ inline QuickRecord controls
            └─ optional record description
```

The cards edit the activity's record for today inline. They do not open the
activity-definition drawer or introduce a record drawer. Definition editing
stays on `/tasks`.

## Home's job

| Owns | Does not own |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Section/card composition and layout | Activity or record domain rules |
| Mount `useHomeTodayQuery` | A Home-only query key or cache |
| Inject `QuickRecord` into each card | Record API calls or cache mutation logic |
| Render pending, error, and empty states | A second save/sync pipeline |
| Future realtime/offline mount points | Activity-definition editing |

`useHomeTodayQuery` is a memoized selector over
`["activities", "task"]` and `["activityRecords", currentMonth]`. The Home
route seeds those same canonical caches during SSR, so the list has no private
Home payload and no initial client refetch flash.

---

## Today membership and progress

`buildTodayActivities` joins task definitions with today's record. An
unarchived task appears when it is scheduled today or already has a record for
today. The record wins over later schedule edits, matching the calendar's
history-always-visible rule.

`deriveTodayProgress` owns per-dimension value / goal / remaining / percent and
goal-aware `done`, using `resolveRecordConfiguration` so recorded days keep
their frozen mode/goals. Home cards render those dimensions as:

- stacked `value/goal` lines (`Xm/Ym` for minutes);
- `Count:` / `Minutes:` prefixes only when both dimensions are present;
- one donut before the title — the average of bounded percents (presentation
  only; completion stays per-dimension in the entity).

Home does not recalculate domain completion or invent a second progress model.

## Inline recording

`QuickRecord` dispatches controls from the **effective** tracking mode (record
snapshot when present, otherwise `activity.trackingMode`):

- `boolean` — done toggle;
- `count` — count stepper;
- `duration` — minute stepper and timer;
- `count+duration` — both count and minute controls, each labeled.

`useQuickRecord` updates local values immediately, then debounces an absolute
record upsert for 500 ms. Count and duration edits preserve the other
dimension. Returning all meaningful dimensions to zero deletes an existing
record instead. The entity mutation hooks own optimistic cache updates,
rollback, and server reconciliation; PostgreSQL captures immutable tracking/goal
snapshots on first insert.

The duration timer is client-local. While running it adds one minute every
60 seconds through the same `useQuickRecord` path. Stopping preserves the
current value; reload resumes from persisted minutes, not elapsed wall-clock
time. Background-tab interval throttling is accepted for the current MVP.

---

## Consistency

```text
QuickRecord
  → useQuickRecord
  → record mutation hook
  → synchronizeActivityCaches
  → ["activityRecords", month]
  → Home Today + Tasks calendar + Progress recompute
```

Home does not have a branch in the synchronization hub. Every consumer derives
from the same definitions and month-record caches.
